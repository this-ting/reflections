What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	when you initialize a repository, via git init, it creates the file .git. This 
	is a invisible metadata file that logs all the commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area, is where you put the final draft to be place before it gets 
	published. It offers more flexibility in the middle.








Terminal Controls
	git init - creates git repository
	git status 
	git add - adds it to the staging area before you add it to the repsitory
	git commit - commits it from staging area to repository
