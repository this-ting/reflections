When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To back up the changes, or put public once it is ready 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Maybe you are working on a new feature, and doesnt want it to clash with someone else's edits
